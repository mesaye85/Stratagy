# Structural Governance Index: Data Collection Protocol

## Research Objective

This protocol guides data collection for the **Structural Governance Index** — a quantitative framework measuring institutional responsiveness and citizen-state interaction patterns across nation-states.

### Methodological Framework

This index employs:
- Institutional Analysis: Quantifying formal and informal governance structures
- Behavioral Metrics: Measuring observable citizen-state interactions
- Outcome-Based Assessment: Evaluating system performance through measurable outputs

The framework quantifies institutional responsiveness capacity through 20 empirically measurable variables across five analytical dimensions.

---

## Data Collection Structure

Each country receives quantitative assessment across:
- 20 measured variables
- 5 analytical dimensions
- 0–10 numerical scale

### Required Data Points
1. Numerical score (0 to 10)
2. Operational definition (measurement criteria)
3. Data source (official statistics, legal documents, verified records)

> Data Quality Standard: Only use quantifiable, verifiable data sources. Exclude opinion surveys, perception indices, or subjective assessments.

## Analytical Dimensions

### 1. Leadership Transition Mechanisms
*Quantifies institutional processes for executive turnover*

| Variable | Operational Definition | Measurement Indicators |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Leadership Turnover Rate | Frequency and method of executive transitions over 20-year period | Constitutional processes, electoral cycles, transition documentation |
| Sub-national Autonomy | Degree of budgetary and policy independence at municipal/regional level | Revenue generation authority, policy implementation scope |
| Policy Adaptation Rate | Institutional response time to formal citizen input mechanisms | Legislative response to petitions, policy revision cycles |

### 2. Institutional Representation Patterns
*Measures demographic correspondence between governance and population*

| Variable | Operational Definition | Measurement Indicators |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Administrative-Population Language Correlation | Alignment between official administrative language and population linguistic composition | Census data vs. government operational language |
| Socioeconomic Representation Index | Proportional representation of income/education groups in governance structures | Legislative member backgrounds, candidate qualification requirements |
| Civil-Military Authority Distribution | Extent of civilian control over military budget and strategic decisions | Organizational charts, budget allocation authority, command structure |
| Legal Framework Accessibility | Institutional barriers to political organization and economic competition | Registration requirements, licensing procedures, legal protections |

### 3. Basic Service Delivery Capacity
*Evaluates state provision of fundamental services*

| Variable | Operational Definition | Measurement Indicators |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Healthcare Accessibility Rate | Geographic and economic access to basic medical services | Facility distribution, coverage statistics, cost barriers |
| Educational Completion Rate | Secondary education completion across income and geographic strata | Graduation statistics by demographic groups |
| Food Security Coefficient | Domestic food production relative to consumption requirements | Agricultural output data, import dependency ratios |
| Internal Mobility Index | Legal and practical barriers to domestic migration for employment | Residency requirements, work permit systems, housing regulations |

### 4. System Confidence Indicators
*Measures behavioral indicators of citizen system assessment*

| Variable | Operational Definition | Measurement Indicators |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Civic Engagement Rate | Participation in formal and informal political organizations | Organization registration data, membership statistics |
| Social Mobility Pathways | Documented cases of socioeconomic advancement through institutional channels | Career progression data, educational outcomes |
| Population Retention Rate | Migration patterns relative to economic and political conditions | Emigration statistics, demographic trends |
| Institutional Adaptation Frequency | Rate of formal institutional modification in response to citizen demands | Constitutional amendments, legal reforms, structural changes |

### 5. Long-term Investment Behaviors
*Analyzes population behaviors indicating system confidence*

| Variable | Operational Definition | Measurement Indicators |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Organizational Formation Rate | New civic, political, and economic organization registrations | Official registration data, incorporation statistics |
| Demographic Investment Index | Population behaviors indicating long-term settlement | Birth rates, property investment, education enrollment |
| Engagement vs. Exit Ratio | Comparative rates of civic participation versus emigration | Participation statistics relative to out-migration |
| Stated-Revealed Preference Alignment | Correlation between official policies and observable citizen behaviors | Policy announcements vs. measurable behavioral changes |

## Quantification Scale

Use standardized 0–10 scale based on measurable performance:

| Score Range | Quantitative Threshold | Performance Characteristics |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 9-10 | >90th percentile | Optimal institutional performance |
| 7-8 | 70th-89th percentile | High performance with minor gaps |
| 5-6 | 40th-69th percentile | Moderate performance, significant variation |
| 3-4 | 20th-39th percentile | Below-average performance, systemic limitations |
| 1-2 | 5th-19th percentile | Poor performance, major institutional failures |
| 0 | <5th percentile | Institutional absence or dysfunction |

### Documentation Standards
- Each score requires operational definition of measurement criteria
- Must cite quantifiable data sources
- Focus on measurable outcomes, not process descriptions
